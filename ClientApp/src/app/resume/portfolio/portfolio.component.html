<h1 class="portfolio-heading">My Portfolio</h1>

<div class="row">
  <!-- Include portfolio items here -->

  <!-- There's no need to pull these from the backend in the DB, simply bootstrap them in either the portfolio component
       or in a seperate class that handles bootstrapping seperately -->

  <!-- Just include columns of two items -->
</div>

<!-- Look at the list you wrote down of stuff to include -->

<!-- This component should consist of a couple of sub-sections that have your work with links to everything -->

<!-- Include pictures and a brief description of each item -->

<!-- Make this section look sort of fancy -->

<!-- Make something similar to this: https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/about-team/
     But make it so that when images are clicked on they expand with text that the user can read
     either above or below the image -->
